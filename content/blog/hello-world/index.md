Hello, this is a real post and not a first sample post from the generator.
This post is mean to be the first on this blog, satriahrh, which I love it so much and you should too.
This post also ever changing, meaning that what you are reading currently might be different with the future version.
You should be able get from this post these following topics: Who am I, Why am I blogging, What am I going to blogging about, Who am I writing for, How can you get involved.
Thanks to this article, [This is Exactly What Your First Blog Post Should be About](https://www.shoutmeloud.com/write-first-blog-post.html), I was able to get the idea of what to talk about in this first post.

## Who Am I?

My name is Satria Hafizh Rizkitama Harsono.
I often write my name as Satria H R Harsono for short.
Some of my colleagues call me Satria, some of them Hafizh, but I prefer Satria for now.
I am from Yogyakarta, [Yogyakarta - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta).

The one you should know me about is that, I am software engineer, since it is this blog all about.
I started my journey as coder since 17, when I was at last year of high school.
I continue my so called passion to college, taking bachelor degree of informatics engineering at [Universitas Telkom under School of Computing](https://soc.telkomuniversity.ac.id/en/soc-en/).

You can quick look my engineering career to my linkedin profile, [linkedin.com/in/satriahrh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/satriahrh/).
I thought that was enough to quick look of how my career is.
For you who prefer non tldr version, I am preparing another long post.
For you who prefer quick explananation in a paragraph, here it is.

I started as Web Developer Intern at Local City Government to build up a room management web app using Code Igniter for at least a month.
A year later after continuing my study, I joined Xtremax Teknologi Indonesia as Backend Developer Intern, it was there I got to know practical engineering is by tweaking content management system using C#.
I worked there for at least 2.5 months, few months later I joined up Bukalapak as Software Engineer Backend Intern.
I learned a lot from there, for at least 3 months I got a chance to build up and maintain a high quality services.

## Why Am I Blogging?

You will be wondering why would you be here?
Exactly because I would share my software engineering experience.
I would rather say that I not really a top and shining engineer.

Actually, I have been looking for story from other engineers of what have they done in their careers.
I ended up Quora, Youtube, or even podcast, rarely I caught a blog in well written format to tell their audience of how could they achieve their life so far.
And here I am fill up that nich and craving some crumbs from it.
I am here to share my experience and my thougts of software engineering career.

For you who prefer watching youtube, I have some recommendations actually and absolutely not me because I don't have one.
For you who prefer podcast, I have also some recommendations.
Both of them would be my content soon.

## What Am I Going to Blogging About?

I was planning on some content format, it keep move on as time flies.
My references are from youtube I am watching and podcast I am listening so far.
Rather than categorizing my content based on topics, it would categorized by content format.

For now, allow me to tell you some post content I have been thinking so far: interview (with report, any content (youtube, podcast, article, blog, book, conference) review by me, reportation of some phenomenon.
For each of them, I would also make an about page.
It will be some kind of background story of how I came up with an idea to develop that kind of content.

The most important part you should know is that the content of my content would be arround software engineering career journey by me.
At first I considered this topic would be narrowed to how could you be hired to top software engineer job.
It will be much more wide I ever imagine.
Anything related to software engineering career journey will come up to this blog.

## Who Am I Writing For?

If that question is refeering to some organization, community, sponsor (ooh I hope this would be soon!!), the answer is for nobody.
If that question is refeering to the motive of my blog, the answer is me because I want to expose my self as shined as it can be so that some recruiter offering me high salary to join their company.
However if the question is refeering to specific audience am I writing this blog for, the answer would be you!

I believe that my reader is currently working as software engineering working on an IT company or they could be freelance.
I also believe that my reader is software engineer wannabe who currently still preparing their career on some software engineer short course or software engineer degree in a campus.
However I alose beliave that my reader, which is you, is tech recruiter who come here to screen my profile :D and you definitely offer me interesting job!

I wouldn't mind if you are not from software engineer likely.
You could consume my post as you like, as you enjoy.
The thing is just don't be mad if you will come into some confusing of some keywords you do not understand.
I will be patient if you ask me nicely, but just be mind that this is about my software engineering career journey :)

## How Can You Get Involced?

I have three channels for you to get involed on my blog.
The absolute way is by reading my content, by subscribing my content, and check up on my blog regularly even if this blog doesn't have any reminder system.
I would be very happy when I look up onto the Google Analytics report of my blog, found out that the number of return visitor is insancely high.

The second channel would be email me to [`blog.satriahrh<at>gmail<dot>com`](mailto:blog.satriahrh@gmail.com).
I am hoping that you would send me some email for more private and long story there.
You can email me with a casual one, or I believe there are some guy out there using an email to send a formal text.
Thats up to you guys and I will be very flexible to my reader.

The third channel is twitter, [@satriahrh](twitter.com/satriahrh).
This is because I love twitter, period.
I am also hoping that you could mention me in your tweet or actively reply me with a cool stuff.
I will be very interested to seeing you guys there.

## Afterword

I have made up my mind for this blog to be a place where I can share my thought regarding my software engineering career journey.
However I still hadn't forbid any idea of surrounding content, since it is a wide topic actually.
And you might got a very wrong idea of this blog untill you found out that the content you will reading up is not about software engineering career journey, and I won't be sorry for that.
Lastly, I hope you enjoy my blog and give me your thought through email to [`blog.satriahrh<at>gmail<dot>com`](mailto:blog.satriahrh@gmail.com) or tweet me to twitter [@satriahrh](twitter.com/satriahrh)
